In the segmentation part, the integration of a shape prior is to be done. I am still examining the literature due to different integration procedures. Most of my focus in January and February will be on this part.

For the fluorescent intensity step, I will try to improve the accuracy of so far used approach based on the approximation of image histogram by Gaussian mixture models.

Finally, I am still searching for a method that will allow me to capture a shape and texture representation of an object in a human interpretable way. After the exam period, I will mainly focused on this part.
